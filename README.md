# underwaterImage

this repository contains codes to process underwater images.
When a camera is underwater, the photos taken are usually tinted by a green-blue filter. The colors are lost due to different wavelengths in the water.
This code manipulates the pixel values of each color channel and estimates the correct coler value of each pixel.

# requirements
